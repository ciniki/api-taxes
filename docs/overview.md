The taxes module stores the tax types and rates used by a business.  This module keeps
the tax information separate from the POS modules, so a POS module can be changed without
affecting the current tax rate information for products.

The taxes module can be expanded in the future to link out to a tax calculation service
such as avalara, which will calculate invoice taxes based on shipping from and to addresses.

Any businesses not doing shipping will only need to be concerned about their local tax codes,
and can be completely contained within this module.
